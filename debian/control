Description: Filesystem reconnaissance toolkit for humans and AI agents
 fsuite provides four composable CLI utilities that turn filesystem
 exploration into a clean, scriptable, agent-friendly pipeline:
 .
  * fsearch - Find files by name, extension, or glob pattern
  * fcontent - Search inside files for text (powered by ripgrep)
  * ftree - Visualize directory structure with smart defaults and recon mode
  * fmap - Extract structural skeleton of code files (code cartography)
 .
 Each tool outputs in multiple formats (pretty, paths, JSON) for both
 human and programmatic consumption. Includes telemetry analytics via
 fmetrics for performance tracking.
